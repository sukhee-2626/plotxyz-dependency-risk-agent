- Keep the deterministic path working without any paid API key.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, `node_modules`, build output, or local SQLite data.
- Keep the agent's logic original and scoped; do not replace it with a generic chatbot endpoint.
- Document new inputs, limits, and failure modes.
